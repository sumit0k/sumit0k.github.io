# Sumit's Resume
---
> I can help you either set up a data culture from scratch or grow it exponentially from the current state. I have worked on the scale of millions in the first organisation and billions in the second one, hoping to scale myself and the systems to handle trillions of data points.

### What makes me qualified:

- Helped build a team of upto 10 distributed data engineers from non existent team of 2 engineers in a span of 3 years along with fulfilling the analytics requirement of organisation and ever growing data
- Built "Data transformation platform" from scratch and led a team to build "Data integration platform" in the current organisation with the aim of data democratisation. These platforms handled most of the use-cases present with data and pushed the company to be more data centric.
- Built distributed, resilient and scalable the systems to handle millions of data points in first organisation and then upto 10s billions of data points per month in the current one.
